# Finite-Difference-Integrator-for-Heat-Diffsuion

This is a finite difference integrator for solving the 2D heat diffusion equation: U_t = U_xx + U_yy + r(x,y), where r(x,y) is an arbitrary static heat source distribution over the computational domain. In this code, the computational domain is set to be rectangular, discretized by Cartesian grids. The code contains both an explicit integrator and an implicit integrator, subject to mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The simulation produce by the code resembles the real-life scenario of an empty rectangular room bounded by heat conductors (such as glass windows, represented by the Dirichlet boundary condition) and heat insulators (such as walls, represented by the Neumann boundary condition), with an arbitrary steady heat source embedded in the room. By running the simulation, the user can obtain the time-evolution of the heat distribution across the rectangular room. Both the boundary setup and the distribution of the static heat source r(x,y) are free for the user to define.
